# PawPal

PawPal is the main project of Team ID C241-PS174 which aims to provide information about pets, especially cats. The main feature of this application is a cat breed detection system using Image Classification technology. Apart from that, we also have features about diseases in cats, food recommendations, and the nearest hospital. We hope that this application can help cat lovers to receive accurate information and can help in caring for their pets.
